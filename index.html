            <h2>Founder</h2>
            <p>Rusty Humphries is the founder of MyBFF Coach, a human-centered AI platform built to restore connection, continuity, and trust in an increasingly disconnected world.</p>
            <p>Over more than four decades, Humphries has worked in environments where attention cannot be demanded and trust cannot be faked &mdash; spanning national broadcasting, large-scale brand leadership, and applied behavioral systems. Across these domains, one pattern became clear: people don't change because they're given better information. They change when they feel understood, remembered, and guided by something consistent over time.</p>
            <p>MyBFF Coach was created from that understanding. The platform is built on the belief that intelligence alone is not enough &mdash; and that most modern technology fails not because it lacks capability, but because it lacks continuity. MyBFF Coach pairs advanced AI with persistent human understanding, designed so users don't feel processed or reset, but known. Less like a tool, more like a reliable presence that grows alongside them.</p>
            <p>One of the platform's first specialized implementations, Coach Jeff, reflects this philosophy directly. Designed to support veterans living with PTSD, Coach Jeff is built for continuity and trust &mdash; a system that does not disengage when conversations get difficult, does not forget what matters, and does not disappear when consistency is needed most. Trust is not rushed. It's earned, gradually.</p>
            <p>Humphries remains deeply involved in the long-term development of the platform, with a deliberate focus on durability, ethical scale, and systems designed to serve people over years &mdash; not sessions. MyBFF Coach is not built to impress quickly. It is built to last.</p>
